                <p class="afterHeader">

                    Education can only fulfill its promise as the great equalizer
                    —a force that can overcome differences in privilege and background—
                    when we work to ensure that students are in school every day and receive
                    the supports they need to learn and thrive.    </p>
                <p>

                    At the same time, we know that many students experience tremendous
                    adversity in their lives—including poverty, health challenges,
                    community violence, and difficult family circumstances—that can make
                    it difficult for them to get to school every day to take advantage of
                    opportunities to learn and grow.
                </p>



                <p>Students who are chronically absent—meaning they miss at least
                  15 days of school in a year—are at serious risk of falling behind
                  in school. Yet few states collect information about chronic absenteeism, and
                  for too long this crisis in our nation’s public elementary and secondary schools has not
                   been fully understood. The release of the U.S. Department’s 2013-2014 Civil Rights Data
                    Collection marks a turning point in the effort to reduce and ultimately eliminate chronic
                     absenteeism so that all students can reach their full potential. For the first time, the CRDC collected data on students who miss at least three weeks of
                      school. 99.5% of all public schools participated in the survey, resulting in
                       the most comprehensive portrait of chronic absenteeism in our country to date.</p>

                <p>

                  This interactive data story analyzes the new data to explore who is most impacted by chronic absenteeism;
                  when in the educational pipeline it tends to be severe; and how chronic absenteeism compares
                  in cities and towns across the country.

                <h2 class="line">A Generation at Risk</h2>
                <p>The Department of Education found that chronic absenteeism is
                  widespread—almost one out of every eight students missed three weeks or more of school in
                   2013-2014. Why were so many students
                  absent from school? The reasons are as varied as the challenges our
                  students and families face—including health, transportation, and
                  safety—which can be particularly acute in disadvantaged communities
                  and areas of concentrated poverty.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 3.5em;">Whatever its causes, chronic absenteeism can be devastating:</p>

                        <p>Children who are chronically absent in preschool, kindergarten, and first grade are much less likely to read at grade level by the third grade. Students who cannot read at grade level by the end of third grade are four times more likely than proficient readers to drop out of high school.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p>A study of public school students in Utah found that an incidence of chronic absenteeism in even a single year between eighth and 12th grade was associated with a seven-fold increase in the likelihood of dropping out.</p>

                <p style="margin-top:3.5em;">Let’s take a closer look at which groups of students are more
                  likely to be chronically absent. Disparities in chronic absenteeism by key demographic
                  characteristics are evident, though unacceptable levels of chronic absenteeism exist for
                  all students.</p>

                <p style="margin-top:1.5em;">There is a bright spot in the data: English learners are 1.2 times less likely to be chronically absent then their non-English learner peers. Less than 11 percent of English learners are chronically absent compared to more than 13 percent of non-English learners.</p>

                <p>The same is not true for students with disabilities who are 1.3 times more likely to be chronically absent than students without disabilities. The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is intended to ensure all students with disabilities have access to a free, appropriate education yet chronic absence complicates efforts toward that goal.</p>

                <p>At roughly 13 percent each, male and female students are similarly likely to be chronically absent. Additional analyses revealed this symmetry held true within racial and ethnic categories as well.</p>

                <p>
                    Chronic absence occurs at every grade level but is more concentrated in some grades than others. Understanding when students are most at risk of missing too much school along the K-12 continuum is the first step toward developing targeted interventions for chronic absenteeism that will help strengthen the entire public education pipeline. CRDC contains data at the school level  and shows that, overall, high schools have the highest rates of chronic absenteeism. However, other research  suggests that students in the early elementary grades also experience high rates of chronic absenteeism, which may be masked when combined with the other elementary grades.

                    For each subgroup of students there is a similar pattern: the likelihood of chronic absenteeism increases as students progress though middle and high school. Notably, the stronger attendance observed among English learners overall dissipates over time, such that they experience higher chronic absenteeism than their non-English learner peers when they reach high school.
