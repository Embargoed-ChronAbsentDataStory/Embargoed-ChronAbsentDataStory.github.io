								<h2 class="line">Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's Commitment to Educational Innovation</h2>
								<p>Developing new software for K-12 schools. Investing in groundbreaking ed-tech startups. Donating tens of millions of dollars to schools experimenting with fresh approaches to customizing the classroom experience.</p>
								<p>All reflect Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's passion for advancing educational equity through technology. The U.S. Department of Education shares that commitment and recently built the <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/">College Scorecard</a>,
									 a digital tool that gives students and their advocates a new way to find and compare colleges across the factors that matter to them.</p>

								<div class="row uniform">
									<div class="12$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/scorecarduse.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
								</div>
								<p></p>
								<p>Underlying the College Scorecard tool is the College Scorecard API, which provides access to a massive, unprecedented dataset on U.S. colleges.</p>
								<p>For the first time, developers can quickly and easily retrieve information on students' outcomes at specific colleges, including former students' earnings; graduates' student debt; and borrowers' repayment rates. This data is also available for various sub-groups, like first generation and Pell students.
								<p>Others have already used the API to create innovative new resources for students and to drive transparency around college choice. We think Facebook would be interested in doing the same.</p>

								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-comments"></span>

									<h3>Deeper Market Penetration</h3>
									<p>The chatbot could enhance the practical value of using Facebook for key audiences, including young people and other prospective students. Additionally, as Facebook asserts greater influence in the ed tech sector, the chatbot could prove a critical tool to a wide swath of stakeholders.</p>
